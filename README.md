# 🛒 Fluxstore

Fluxstore is an **e-commerce website** built during my internship, where I learned **Angular (non-standalone)** for the frontend and **NestJS** for the backend. This project was a **foundational full-stack learning experience**, covering authentication, modular UI design, backend API handling, and database integration.

## ✨ Features

✅ User Authentication (Login, Sign Up)
✅ Product Browsing & Details View
✅ Shopping Cart & Shipping Flow
✅ Order Placement & Tracking
✅ Clean, Responsive Angular UI
✅ Modular NestJS Backend with MySQL
